## 1. What is `sudo`?
 
`sudo` (**S**uper**U**ser **DO**) is a command-line utility that allows a permitted user to execute a command as the **superuser** (root) or another user, as specified by the security policy.
 
### Why use `sudo`?
 
- Avoids logging in directly as `root` (safer).
- Provides an **audit trail** — every `sudo` command is logged in `/var/log/auth.log` (Debian/Ubuntu) or `/var/log/secure` (RHEL/CentOS).
- Allows **fine-grained** permission control (give specific users access to specific commands).
### Basic Syntax
 
```bash
sudo [options] <command>
```
 
### Examples
 
**Example 1:** Update package list (requires root)
```bash
sudo apt update
```
 
**Example 2:** Edit a system file
```bash
sudo nano /etc/hosts
```
 
**Example 3:** Run a command as another user
```bash
sudo -u www-data whoami
# Output: www-data
```
 
**Example 4:** Switch to root shell
```bash
sudo -i
# or
sudo su -
```
 
**Example 5:** Run the previous command with sudo
```bash
sudo !!
```
 
### Common Options
 
| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `-u <user>` | Run command as a specific user |
| `-i` | Start a login shell as root |
| `-s` | Start a non-login shell as root |
| `-l` | List allowed commands for the current user |
| `-k` | Invalidate cached credentials (force re-prompt) |
| `-v` | Extend sudo timeout without running a command |

-s → Starts a non-login shell as root. Example: sudo -s (opens a root shell without loading a full login environment).
-l → Starts a login shell as root. Example: sudo -l (lists allowed sudo commands) / sudo -i (opens a root login shell).
-k → Invalidates the sudo timestamp, forcing password re-entry next time. Example: sudo -k.
-v → Refreshes/validates your sudo credentials without running a command. Example: sudo -v.
 
---
 
## 2. The `/etc/sudoers` File

/etc/sudoers → The main configuration file that controls which users can run commands with sudo privileges.
 
The `/etc/sudoers` file defines **who can run what** as which user, and from which terminal.
 
>  **WARNING:** Never edit `/etc/sudoers` directly with a regular text editor. Always use the `visudo` command — it validates syntax before saving and prevents you from locking yourself out.
 
```bash
sudo visudo

```
john ALL=(ALL ALL
visudo will detect the error and warn you before saving. A syntax error in /etc/sudoers can break sudo and potentially lock you out of administrative access.

 
### Sudoers Syntax
 
```
user    host=(runas_user:runas_group)    commands
```

Here's what each part means:

user → The user who is allowed to run the command.
host → The computer/server where this rule applies.
runas_user → The user account that the command can be run as.
runas_group → The group that the command can be run as.
commands → The specific commands the user is allowed to execute.
 
### Example Entries

**Example 1:** Allow user alice full root privileges

```
alice   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

```

 
**Example 2:** Allow user `John` to restart apache2

```
john ALL=(root:root) /usr/bin/systemctl restart apache2

```
 
**Example 3:** Allow group `sysadmins` to run all commands
```
%sysadmins   ALL=(ALL) ALL
```
(The `%` prefix denotes a group.)
 
**Example 4:** Allow `bob` to restart Apache without a password
```
bob   ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/systemctl restart apache2
```
 
**Example 5:** Allow `dev` to run only specific commands
```
dev   ALL=(ALL) /usr/bin/apt update, /usr/bin/apt upgrade
```
 
**Example 6:** Deny dangerous commands using aliases
```
Cmnd_Alias DANGEROUS = /bin/rm, /sbin/shutdown, /sbin/reboot
intern     ALL=(ALL) ALL, !DANGEROUS
```

Creates a shortcut named DANGEROUS containing these commands:

/bin/rm → delete files
/sbin/shutdown → shut down the system
/sbin/reboot → restart the system

User intern
On all hosts (ALL)
Can run commands as any user ((ALL))
Can run all commands (ALL)
Except those listed in DANGEROUS (!DANGEROUS)

In simple English

The user intern can use sudo to run almost any command as any user, but cannot use:

sudo rm
sudo shutdown
sudo reboot
 
### Including Drop-in Files
 
Modern Linux uses `/etc/sudoers.d/` for modular config:
 
```bash
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/myrules
```
 
This is preferred because package updates won't overwrite custom rules.
 
### Viewing Your Privileges
 
```bash
sudo -l
```
 
---
 
## 3. The `/etc/passwd` File
 
Stores **basic user account information**. World-readable (any user can view it).
 
```bash
cat /etc/passwd
```
 
### Format
 
Each line has **7 fields** separated by colons (`:`):
 
```
username:password:UID:GID:GECOS:home_directory:shell
```
 
### Example Entry
 
```
john:x:1001:1001:John Doe,Engineering,555-1234:/home/john:/bin/bash
```
 
### Field Breakdown
 
| # | Field | Example | Description |
|---|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Username | `john` | Login name |
| 2 | Password | `x` | `x` means password is in `/etc/shadow` |
| 3 | UID | `1001` | User ID (`0` = root, `1-999` = system, `1000+` = regular) |
| 4 | GID | `1001` | Primary Group ID |
| 5 | GECOS | `John Doe,...` | Full name and contact info |
| 6 | Home dir | `/home/john` | User's home directory |
| 7 | Shell | `/bin/bash` | Login shell (`/usr/sbin/nologin` for service accounts) |
 
### Common UID Ranges
 
```
0           → root
1-99        → reserved system accounts
100-999     → system services (daemons)
1000-60000  → regular users
65534       → nobody
```
 
### Example: Service Account
 
```
www-data:x:33:33:www-data:/var/www:/usr/sbin/nologin
```
Notice the shell is `/usr/sbin/nologin` — this account cannot log in interactively.
 
---
 
## 4. The `/etc/shadow` File
 
Stores **encrypted user passwords** and password aging info. Readable **only by root**.
 
```bash
sudo cat /etc/shadow
```
 
### Format
 
Each line has **9 fields** separated by colons (`:`):
 
```
username:password_hash:lastchange:min:max:warn:inactive:expire:reserved
```
 
### Example Entry
 
```
john:$6$xyz123$a7Hk9JmN2pQR.wEr8Yt5...:19567:0:99999:7:::
```
 
### Field Breakdown
 
| # | Field | Example | Description |
|---|-------|---------|-------------|
| 1 | Username | `john` | Must match `/etc/passwd` |
| 2 | Password hash | `$6$xyz...` | Hashed password (see formats below) |
| 3 | Last change | `19567` | Days since 1970-01-01 since password change |
| 4 | Min days | `0` | Minimum days between password changes |
| 5 | Max days | `99999` | Maximum days password is valid |
| 6 | Warn | `7` | Days before expiry to warn user |
| 7 | Inactive | (empty) | Days after expiry before account is locked |
| 8 | Expire | (empty) | Account expiration date (days since 1970) |
| 9 | Reserved | (empty) | Reserved for future use |
 
### Password Hash Prefixes
 
| Prefix | Algorithm |
|--------|-----------|
| `$1$` | MD5 (deprecated, insecure) |
| `$2a$` / `$2y$` | Blowfish (bcrypt) |
| `$5$` | SHA-256 |
| `$6$` | SHA-512 (most common today) |
| `$y$` | yescrypt (modern Linux default) |
 
### Special Password Field Values
 
- `*` or `!` → Account is **locked** (cannot log in with password)
- Empty → **No password required** (dangerous!)
- `*LK*` → Locked by administrator
### Useful Commands
 
**Lock a user account:**
```bash
sudo passwd -l john
```
 
**Unlock a user account:**
```bash
sudo passwd -u john
```
 
**Check password aging info:**
```bash
sudo chage -l john
```
 
**Force user to change password on next login:**
```bash
sudo chage -d 0 john
```

## 5. Quick Comparison
 
| Feature | `/etc/passwd` | `/etc/shadow` | `/etc/sudoers` |
|---------|---------------|---------------|----------------|
| **Purpose** | User account info | Password hashes & aging | Privilege rules |
| **Permissions** | `644` (world-readable) | `640` or `000` (root only) | `440` (root only) |
| **Owner** | `root:root` | `root:shadow` | `root:root` |
| **Edit with** | `useradd` / `usermod` | `passwd` | `visudo` |
| **Field separator** | `:` | `:` | space / `=` |
 
### Verify Permissions
 
```bash
ls -l /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/sudoers
```

lists the permissions, ownership, size, and timestamps of these important system files.
 
Expected output:
```
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   /etc/passwd
-rw-r----- 1 root shadow /etc/shadow
-r--r----- 1 root root   /etc/sudoers
```

##  Security Best Practices
 
1. **Never** edit `/etc/sudoers` without `visudo`.
2. **Never** give blanket `NOPASSWD: ALL` rights unless absolutely necessary.
3. Use `/etc/sudoers.d/` for modular, easy-to-manage rules.
4. Regularly audit `/etc/passwd` for unexpected UID `0` accounts (besides root).
5. Ensure `/etc/shadow` permissions remain `640` or stricter.
6. Enforce strong password policies via `/etc/login.defs` and PAM.
7. Monitor `/var/log/auth.log` for suspicious sudo activity.
### Audit Example: Find all UID 0 accounts
 
```bash
awk -F: '$3 == 0 {print $1}' /etc/passwd
```
Only `root` should appear. Any other user with UID 0 is a security red flag.
