Scenario:

A production application is crashing intermittently. Users are reporting downtime and failed requests.

You have been provided with a log file: app_issue.log

Your task is to analyze the logs and identify the root cause of the issue.

Use Linux commands to investigate and answer the following questions.


### copy this log in your own vm and troubleshoot with this log.





###
What is the main issue observed in the logs?
Which process is causing the problem?
What is the PID of the affected process?
What message indicates the system ran out of memory?
Were there any warning signs before the failure? If yes, mention them.
What was the memory condition of the system at the time of failure?
How much memory was the process consuming (approx)?
Which component restarted after the failure?
Why did the system kill that specific process?
What is the role of the OOM killer in Linux?
What impact did this issue have on other services (e.g., web server)?
Is this a one-time issue or a recurring problem? Justify your answer from logs.
What are possible root causes of this issue? (list at least 3)
How would you prevent this issue in production?
What monitoring or alerting would you implement?
